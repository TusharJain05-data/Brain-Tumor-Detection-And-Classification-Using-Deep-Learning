# Brain-Tumor-Detection-And-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

Technologies Used : Python, TensorFlow/Keras, VGG16, CNN, Scikit Learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Flask, Amazon AWS

Developed a deep learning based system for brain tumor detection from MRI images using computer vision techniques. 
Applied image preprocessing and data augmentation to improve model accuracy and robustness. 
Built a VGG16-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning to classify tumor and non-tumor images. 
Evaluated the model using performance metrics such as accuracy and classification reports. 
Designed and implemented a Flask-based web UI for real-time MRI image upload and prediction. 
Deployed the application on Amazon AWS, enabling cloud-based access and scalability.
